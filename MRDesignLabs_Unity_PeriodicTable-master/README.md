# Periodic Table of the Elements
Periodic Table of the Elements is an open-source sample app from Microsoft's Mixed Reality Design Labs. It demonstrates how to use **[Mixed Reality Toolkit(MRTK)](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity)**'s input system and building blocks to create an app experience for HoloLens and Immersive headsets. In this project, you can find the examples of:
- Use MRTK's **[MixedRealityCamera](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/blob/master/Assets/HoloToolkit/Input/Prefabs/MixedRealityCamera.prefab)** and **[InputManager](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/blob/master/Assets/HoloToolkit/Input/Prefabs/InputManager.prefab)** for HoloLens gesture input and Immersive headset's motion controller input
- Layout an array of objects in 3D space with various surface types using **MRTK's [Object Collection](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/blob/master/Assets/HoloToolkit-Examples/UX/Readme/README_ObjectCollection.md)**. 
- Create objects that respond to the standard inputs using **MRTK's [Interactable Object](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/blob/master/Assets/HoloToolkit-Examples/UX/Readme/README_InteractableObjectExample.md)**. 
- Loading and parsing local JSON file data using Unity's JsonUtility

You can use this project's components to create your own mixed reality app experiences.

# Technical Details

Open **MRDL_PeriodicTable\Scenes\Main.unity** to view the main scene. You will see a deactivated prefab called **ElementContainer** - activate it and navigate to 'Element' in the hierarchy. You will see three components: **Element, ElementButton**, and **PresentToPlayer**.

**ElementButton** extends the abstract Button class - its job is to listen for state change events. It passes these events along to Element, which then handles displaying and animating information about the element. It relies in part on **PresentToPlayer**, which orients and moves the box toward the player.
 
Deeper in the prefab you'll find an **MoleculeObject** with the **Atom** component attached. This script uses Unity's instanced rendering API to draw hundreds of mesh particles with very few draw calls. This can be a useful alternative to Shuriken particle systems, which aren't always performant enough for Hololens devices without a great deal of careful tweaking.

Box elements use the **AcrylicReflective** and **AcrylicReflectiveTransparent shaders** These can be used in other projects for anything that needs a shiny, stylized look without tanking the frame rate.
 
The **ObjectCollectionMode** script inherits from one of HUX's most powerful tools, the **InteractionReceiver** class. With it you can rapidly set up an object to listen for input from HUX buttons. Just use the inspector to drag HUX buttons to the Interactables array, override a base function like OnTapped, and you're ready to go.

If you're rapidly prototyping, using the button's name to differentiate input is a quick way to get things done. You could also create a custom component that information relevant to a button's function.

https://github.com/Microsoft/MRDesignLabs_Unity_LunarModule

Lunar Module is a open-source sample app from Microsoft's Mixed Reality Design Labs, it is a spiritual sequel to the 1979 Atari classic, *Lunar Lander*. This sample app will demonstrate how to extend Hololens' base gestures with two hand tracking and xbox controller input, reactive objects to surface mapping and plane finding, and simple menu systems. You can use this project's components to create your own mixed reality app experience.
